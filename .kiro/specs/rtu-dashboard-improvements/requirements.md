# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for updating and improving the existing RTU dashboard specifically for Layer 1 (Teltonika RUT956 Gateway Monitoring). The current dashboard has duplicate sections, cluttered alerts, and missing key monitoring capabilities. This enhancement focuses on simplifying the interface, removing redundancies, adding comprehensive system monitoring features, and improving the overall user experience for RTU gateway management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want a clean and simplified dashboard interface without duplicate sections, so that I can quickly access relevant information without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the RTU dashboard THEN the system SHALL display only one "Communication Status / Connected Devices / Active Alerts / Signal Strength" block at the top
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL remove any duplicate status blocks that appear elsewhere on the page
3. WHEN navigating the dashboard THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent layout without redundant information sections
4. WHEN viewing status information THEN the system SHALL present it in a logical hierarchy with clear visual separation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want simplified and grouped alert management, so that I can focus on critical issues without being overwhelmed by repetitive notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Active Alerts table THEN the system SHALL group repeated alerts (Router Uptime, Connection State, GSM Signal) into single rows with latest values
2. WHEN alerts are grouped THEN the system SHALL display the most recent timestamp and current status for each alert type
3. WHEN off-hours alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL move them to a low-priority log section instead of the main alerts view
4. WHEN multiple similar alerts exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them with a count indicator showing total occurrences
5. IF no critical alerts are present THEN the system SHALL display a clear "No Active Alerts" status message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want intelligent data visualization that only shows relevant information, so that I can make informed decisions based on available data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no data is available for the 24-Hour Readings Trend THEN the system SHALL hide the trend chart completely
2. WHEN trend data is available THEN the system SHALL always display at least one useful metric with Signal Strength as the default
3. WHEN multiple metrics are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which metrics to display in the trend chart
4. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators instead of empty charts
5. IF historical data exists but is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display available data with clear indicators of missing periods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want simplified device status indicators in the Connected Devices card, so that I can quickly assess overall system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Connected Devices card THEN the system SHALL replace "600 Alerts" with a simple Critical/Warning/OK status indicator
2. WHEN critical issues exist THEN the system SHALL display only the critical alert count prominently
3. WHEN no critical issues exist THEN the system SHALL show "All Systems OK" or similar positive status message
4. WHEN warning conditions exist THEN the system SHALL display warning count separately from critical alerts
5. IF device status cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL show "Status Unknown" with appropriate styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive system health monitoring, so that I can proactively manage router performance and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing system health THEN the system SHALL display Router Uptime in hours with clear formatting
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL show CPU Load as a percentage with visual indicators for high usage
3. WHEN checking resources THEN the system SHALL display Memory Usage as a percentage with color-coded status
4. WHEN CPU load exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL highlight the metric with warning colors
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds 90% THEN the system SHALL display critical status indicators
6. IF system metrics are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show "Data Unavailable" with last known values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a network technician, I want detailed network status information, so that I can troubleshoot connectivity issues and monitor network performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing network status THEN the system SHALL display the current WAN IP address
2. WHEN checking SIM details THEN the system SHALL show ICCID, APN, and Operator Name
3. WHEN monitoring signal quality THEN the system SHALL display RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR values with units
4. WHEN signal quality is poor THEN the system SHALL highlight weak signal metrics with warning indicators
5. WHEN network information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show "Not Connected" or "Data Unavailable" status
6. IF SIM card is not detected THEN the system SHALL display "No SIM Card" with troubleshooting suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a field technician, I want comprehensive I/O monitoring capabilities, so that I can monitor and control connected equipment remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing digital inputs THEN the system SHALL display DI1 and DI2 status as clear ON/OFF indicators
2. WHEN viewing digital outputs THEN the system SHALL show DO1 and DO2 status with toggle control options
3. WHEN monitoring analog input THEN the system SHALL display the 0-10V reading with appropriate precision
4. WHEN toggling digital outputs THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on successful state changes
5. WHEN I/O operations fail THEN the system SHALL display error messages with retry options
6. IF I/O modules are not responding THEN the system SHALL show "Module Offline" status with diagnostic information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want advanced alert filtering and management capabilities, so that I can efficiently manage notifications and focus on relevant issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing alerts THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by Device, Severity, and Time range
2. WHEN filtering by device THEN the system SHALL show alerts only from selected devices
3. WHEN filtering by severity THEN the system SHALL allow selection of Critical, Warning, or Info level alerts
4. WHEN filtering by time THEN the system SHALL support custom date ranges and preset options (Last Hour, Last Day, Last Week)
5. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL combine them using AND logic
6. WHEN no alerts match filters THEN the system SHALL display "No alerts match current filters" message

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want enhanced trend visualization with multiple metrics support, so that I can analyze system performance over time and identify patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL allow selecting different metrics (Signal Strength, CPU, Analog Input, Memory Usage)
2. WHEN multiple metrics are selected THEN the system SHALL display them in the same chart with different colors and scales
3. WHEN changing metric selection THEN the system SHALL update the chart in real-time without page refresh
4. WHEN hovering over data points THEN the system SHALL show detailed tooltips with exact values and timestamps
5. WHEN no data exists for selected timeframe THEN the system SHALL display "No data available for selected period"
6. IF chart rendering fails THEN the system SHALL show fallback table view with the same data

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want an improved user interface with organized sections and intuitive navigation, so that I can efficiently monitor and manage RTU systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL maintain the card-based layout for consistency
2. WHEN organizing information THEN the system SHALL group System, Network, and I/O sections into collapsible panels
3. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons for CPU, Memory, SIM, and Input/Output indicators
4. WHEN sections are collapsed THEN the system SHALL remember user preferences across sessions
5. WHEN expanding sections THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations for better user experience
6. IF screen space is limited THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust layout for optimal information density
