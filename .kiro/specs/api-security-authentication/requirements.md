# Requirements Document - API Security and Authentication

## Introduction

The Energy Monitor system currently has an API endpoint (`/api/readings`) that accepts readings from the Python Modbus polling service. This endpoint is temporarily configured without authentication for testing purposes. To secure the system for production use, we need to implement proper API authentication using Laravel Sanctum tokens, allowing the Python service to authenticate securely while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Token Authentication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API endpoints to be secured with token-based authentication, so that only authorized services can submit readings to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN the `/api/readings` endpoint SHALL require valid API token authentication
2. WHEN an unauthenticated request is made to `/api/readings` THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
3. WHEN a request with an invalid token is made THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
4. WHEN a request with a valid token is made THEN the system SHALL process the reading normally and return a 201 Created response

### Requirement 2: Token Management System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to generate and manage API tokens through the admin interface, so that I can control access to the API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin panel THEN administrators SHALL be able to view existing API tokens
2. WHEN creating a new token THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, secure token with configurable permissions
3. WHEN a token is created THEN the system SHALL display the token value once for secure storage
4. WHEN managing tokens THEN administrators SHALL be able to revoke/delete existing tokens
5. WHEN a token is revoked THEN all subsequent requests using that token SHALL be rejected

### Requirement 3: Python Service Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a Python service operator, I want the Modbus polling service to automatically authenticate with the Laravel API using a configured token, so that readings can be submitted securely without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python service is configured with an API token THEN it SHALL include the token in all API requests
2. WHEN the token is missing from environment configuration THEN the Python service SHALL log an error and fail gracefully
3. WHEN the API returns authentication errors THEN the Python service SHALL log the error with appropriate details
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the Python service SHALL continue normal operation without changes to existing functionality

### Requirement 4: Token Security and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want API tokens to follow security best practices, so that the system remains secure against common attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are generated THEN they SHALL be cryptographically secure with sufficient entropy
2. WHEN tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be hashed in the database (not stored in plain text)
3. WHEN tokens are transmitted THEN they SHALL be sent via secure headers (Authorization: Bearer)
4. WHEN tokens are logged THEN they SHALL never appear in plain text in log files
5. WHEN tokens expire (if configured) THEN the system SHALL reject expired tokens with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the authentication implementation to be deployed without breaking existing functionality, so that the system remains operational during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is first deployed THEN existing API functionality SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN the Python service is updated with tokens THEN it SHALL continue to send readings successfully
3. WHEN authentication is enabled THEN the health check endpoint SHALL remain publicly accessible
4. WHEN migrating to authenticated endpoints THEN clear documentation SHALL be provided for the transition process

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for authentication events, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot authentication issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure with relevant details (IP, timestamp, reason)
2. WHEN successful authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL log the event for audit purposes
3. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and log the event
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be distinguishable from other API errors in logs and responses
