# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user management system with role-based access control (RBAC) and email notification preferences for the energy monitoring system. The system will support two distinct user roles (admin and operator) with different access levels, authentication requirements, and customizable email notification settings for various alert types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define user roles with specific access permissions, so that I can control what different users can see and modify in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL define exactly two user roles: `admin` and `operator`
2. WHEN an `admin` user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide full access to all panels and settings
3. WHEN an `operator` user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide limited access to only assigned devices and alerts
4. WHEN an `admin` user accesses the system THEN they SHALL be able to view and manage all Devices, Gateways, Alerts, and Users
5. WHEN an `operator` user accesses the system THEN they SHALL be able to view only their assigned Devices, Gateways, and Alerts
6. WHEN an `operator` user attempts to access User Management or System Settings THEN the system SHALL deny access
7. WHEN an `admin` user accesses User Management or System Settings THEN the system SHALL grant full access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system user, I want secure authentication to access the web interface, so that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive energy monitoring data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access any web interface THEN the system SHALL require login authentication
2. WHEN a user attempts to access `/admin` THEN the system SHALL verify authentication before granting access
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page
4. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL maintain their session securely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user profiles with comprehensive information, so that I can maintain accurate user records and contact information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user profile is created THEN it SHALL include the following fields: `name`, `email`, `password`, `phone`, `role`
2. WHEN a user profile is created THEN it SHALL include email notification preferences: `email_notifications` (boolean) and `notification_critical_only` (boolean)
3. WHEN a new user is created THEN the `role` field SHALL default to `operator`
4. WHEN a new user is created THEN the `email_notifications` field SHALL default to `true`
5. WHEN a new user is created THEN the `notification_critical_only` field SHALL default to `false`
6. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to customize my email notification preferences, so that I can control which alerts I receive and avoid notification fatigue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses notification settings THEN they SHALL be able to enable or disable email alerts completely
2. WHEN a user accesses notification settings THEN they SHALL be able to enable "critical only" mode to receive only high-severity alerts
3. WHEN a user enables "critical only" mode THEN they SHALL receive only alerts marked as critical
4. WHEN a user disables email notifications THEN they SHALL not receive any email alerts except critical alerts
5. WHEN an `admin` user accesses notification settings THEN they SHALL be able to modify settings for themselves and other users
6. WHEN an `operator` user accesses notification settings THEN they SHALL be able to modify only their own settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want an automated alert notification system that respects user preferences, so that users receive relevant alerts without being overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates alerts THEN it SHALL support the following alert types: `OutOfRangeAlert`, `OffHoursAlert`, and `CriticalAlert`
2. WHEN an alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications via email using Laravel Notifications
3. WHEN an alert is generated THEN the system SHALL send notifications only to `admin` users who have `email_notifications = true`
4. WHEN an alert is generated AND a user has `notification_critical_only = true` THEN the system SHALL filter out non-critical alerts
5. WHEN a `CriticalAlert` is generated THEN the system SHALL send it to all eligible users regardless of their `notification_critical_only` preference
6. WHEN an `operator` user exists THEN they SHALL not receive any email notifications regardless of alert type
7. WHEN the notification system processes alerts THEN it SHALL log delivery attempts and failures for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want role-based access control in the user interface, so that I only see features and data relevant to my role and responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an `admin` user accesses the Devices section THEN they SHALL have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access
2. WHEN an `operator` user accesses the Devices section THEN they SHALL have view access only to assigned devices
3. WHEN an `admin` user accesses the Gateways section THEN they SHALL have full CRUD access
4. WHEN an `operator` user accesses the Gateways section THEN they SHALL have view access only to assigned gateways
5. WHEN an `admin` user accesses the Alerts section THEN they SHALL have full view access to all alerts
6. WHEN an `operator` user accesses the Alerts section THEN they SHALL have view access only to alerts related to their assigned devices
7. WHEN an `admin` user accesses User Management THEN they SHALL have full access to create, modify, and delete users
8. WHEN an `operator` user attempts to access User Management THEN the system SHALL deny access
9. WHEN users access Notification Settings THEN `admin` users SHALL be able to modify settings for themselves and others, while `operator` users SHALL only modify their own settings
