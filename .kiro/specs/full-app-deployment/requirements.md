# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying a comprehensive remote energy monitoring system that communicates with Modbus meters through cellular routers with fixed IP addresses. The system consists of a Laravel web application with Filament-based modern widget dashboard and a Python Modbus service that performs half-hourly data collection from remote sites. The deployment must support cellular, Wi-Fi, and wired connectivity with automatic WAN failover, GNSS location tracking, and configurable alert notifications for energy consumption monitoring of heaters, A/C, water, lighting, UPS, and server units at small remote sites.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the remote energy monitoring application to a production environment, so that operators can monitor energy consumption at remote sites through cellular networks with fixed IP addresses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process is initiated THEN the system SHALL deploy both the Laravel Filament application and Python Modbus service with cellular router connectivity
2. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify cellular router communication and half-hourly data collection functionality
3. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring cellular connectivity and service status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment scripts and configuration management, so that deployments are consistent and repeatable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment scripts are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically configure the production environment with required dependencies
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL securely manage configuration without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper database migration and data persistence, so that application data is preserved and properly structured in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Laravel application is deployed THEN the system SHALL run database migrations automatically
2. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use secure connection parameters
3. WHEN data storage is configured THEN the system SHALL ensure proper backup and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the deployed application to follow security best practices, so that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all web traffic
2. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols and authentication
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls and API security

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL log important events and errors
2. WHEN system metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide performance monitoring capabilities
3. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts to designated administrators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to handle service dependencies and communication, so that the Laravel app and Python service work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both services are deployed THEN the system SHALL ensure the Python Modbus service can communicate with the Laravel application
2. WHEN the Modbus service collects data THEN the system SHALL ensure data is properly transmitted to the Laravel application's database
3. WHEN services restart THEN the system SHALL automatically re-establish connections between components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an energy monitoring operator, I want a modern widget-based dashboard with controller-specific views, so that I can monitor communication status, GSM signal strength, SIM card information, and device I/O for each remote site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide widget-based interface with modern UI design using Filament framework
2. WHEN viewing a controller dashboard THEN the system SHALL display communication status, SIM card number, GSM signal strength, and GNSS location
3. WHEN monitoring devices THEN the system SHALL show digital inputs/outputs and analog inputs with expandable module support

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a site manager, I want configurable text alerts and notifications for energy consumption thresholds, so that I can receive timely warnings about unusual usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN energy consumption exceeds configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL send SMS/email alerts to designated recipients
2. WHEN operational hours are defined THEN the system SHALL differentiate between operational and out-of-hours usage for alerting
3. WHEN alert conditions are met THEN the system SHALL provide configurable notification templates and escalation procedures

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want usage profile analysis to identify operational vs. out-of-hours consumption, so that I can optimize energy usage and reduce costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN half-hourly data is collected THEN the system SHALL categorize consumption by operational hours vs. out-of-hours periods
2. WHEN usage profiles are generated THEN the system SHALL provide comparative analysis for heaters, A/C, water, lighting, UPS, and server units
3. WHEN consumption patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL highlight opportunities for out-of-hours usage reduction

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a Modbus meter connector registration portal, so that new remote sites and devices can be easily added to the monitoring system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new sites are added THEN the system SHALL provide a registration portal for cellular router configuration with fixed IP addresses
2. WHEN Modbus devices are registered THEN the system SHALL support configuration of device-specific register mappings and parameters
3. WHEN site registration is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically begin half-hourly data collection from the new location

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want automatic WAN failover and multiple connectivity options, so that remote sites maintain communication even when primary connections fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cellular connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to Wi-Fi or wired backup connections
2. WHEN WAN failover occurs THEN the system SHALL log the event and continue data collection without interruption
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL resume primary connection and synchronize any missed data

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want scalable deployment options with support for serial communication interfaces, so that the system can handle varying loads and integrate diverse device types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment architecture is designed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of web application instances
2. WHEN serial communication is needed THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces for integrating varied devices beyond Modbus
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to add or remove service instances and expansion modules
