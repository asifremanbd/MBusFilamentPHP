# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing energy monitoring dashboard system. The current dashboard provides real-time monitoring, alert management, and device status tracking for multiple gateways. This enhancement focuses on implementing user-specific dashboard access based on device and gateway permissions, improving user experience, adding advanced analytics capabilities, and expanding monitoring features to provide deeper insights into energy consumption patterns and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display only devices and gateways for which they have been granted permissions
2. WHEN an administrator assigns device permissions to a user THEN the system SHALL immediately update that user's dashboard to include the authorized devices
3. WHEN a user attempts to access unauthorized device data THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
4. WHEN a user has permissions for multiple gateways THEN the system SHALL provide a gateway selector to switch between authorized gateways
5. IF a user's permissions are revoked THEN the system SHALL immediately remove access to the corresponding dashboard data and widgets
6. WHEN a user views alerts THEN the system SHALL show only alerts from devices and gateways they are authorized to monitor
7. WHEN generating reports or analytics THEN the system SHALL include only data from devices within the user's permission scope

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want advanced filtering and search capabilities on the dashboard, so that I can quickly locate specific devices, alerts, or data points across multiple gateways.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a global search bar that searches across devices, alerts, and gateways
2. WHEN a user enters search criteria THEN the system SHALL filter all dashboard widgets to show only matching results
3. WHEN a user applies date range filters THEN the system SHALL update all historical data displays to show only data within the selected timeframe
4. WHEN a user selects device type filters THEN the system SHALL show only devices matching the selected types
5. IF a user applies multiple filters simultaneously THEN the system SHALL combine all filter criteria using AND logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a user management interface to assign and manage device and gateway permissions, so that I can efficiently control user access across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses user management THEN the system SHALL display a list of all users with their current permission assignments
2. WHEN creating or editing user permissions THEN the system SHALL provide checkboxes or selection lists for available devices and gateways
3. WHEN assigning permissions THEN the system SHALL support bulk assignment of multiple devices or gateways to a user
4. WHEN viewing user permissions THEN the system SHALL show a clear hierarchy of gateway and device relationships
5. IF a gateway is assigned to a user THEN the system SHALL optionally include all devices under that gateway
6. WHEN permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with timestamp and administrator details
7. WHEN a user account is deactivated THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke all associated permissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an energy manager, I want access to both global and gateway-based dashboard views with customizable widgets, so that I can monitor system-wide performance or focus on specific gateway operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide two main dashboard types: Global Dashboard and Gateway-Based Dashboard
2. WHEN viewing the Global Dashboard THEN the system SHALL display widgets showing: system-wide energy consumption summary, total active devices count, critical alerts across all gateways, overall system health status, and top energy-consuming gateways
3. WHEN viewing a Gateway-Based Dashboard THEN the system SHALL display widgets showing: gateway-specific device list, real-time energy readings per device, gateway communication status, device health indicators, gateway-specific alerts, and historical consumption charts for that gateway
4. WHEN a user customizes dashboard layouts THEN the system SHALL allow show/hide, drag-and-drop repositioning, and resizing of individual widgets
5. WHEN a user creates custom layouts THEN the system SHALL save separate configurations for Global and Gateway-Based dashboards per user account
6. IF a user switches between dashboard types THEN the system SHALL maintain separate widget preferences for each dashboard type
7. WHEN a user has limited permissions THEN the Global Dashboard SHALL only aggregate data from authorized gateways and devices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want comprehensive energy analytics and reporting features, so that I can identify consumption patterns and optimize energy usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects analytics view THEN the system SHALL display energy consumption trends over configurable time periods
2. WHEN a user requests comparative analysis THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side comparisons between different devices or time periods
3. WHEN energy consumption exceeds defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate automated efficiency alerts
4. WHEN a user exports reports THEN the system SHALL provide data in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel)
5. IF historical data spans multiple months THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated monthly and yearly summaries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want predictive maintenance insights and device health scoring, so that I can proactively address equipment issues before failures occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN device readings show declining patterns THEN the system SHALL calculate and display health scores for each device
2. WHEN health scores drop below acceptable thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate predictive maintenance alerts
3. WHEN a user views device details THEN the system SHALL show maintenance history and recommended actions
4. WHEN multiple devices show similar degradation patterns THEN the system SHALL group related maintenance recommendations
5. IF a device has been offline for extended periods THEN the system SHALL escalate the alert priority automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time notifications and alert escalation capabilities, so that I can respond quickly to critical system events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications via email and SMS
2. WHEN alerts remain unresolved for defined time periods THEN the system SHALL escalate to supervisory personnel
3. WHEN a user is actively monitoring the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display toast notifications for new alerts
4. WHEN system-wide issues affect multiple gateways THEN the system SHALL group related alerts and provide consolidated notifications
5. IF communication with a gateway is lost THEN the system SHALL immediately notify designated personnel

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want advanced data visualization and export capabilities, so that I can perform detailed analysis and create custom reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects visualization options THEN the system SHALL provide multiple chart types (line, bar, scatter, heatmap)
2. WHEN a user configures custom time ranges THEN the system SHALL allow granular selection from minutes to years
3. WHEN a user exports data THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as device information and measurement units
