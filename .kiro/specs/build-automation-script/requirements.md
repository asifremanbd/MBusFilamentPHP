# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an automated build script that manages XAMPP installation, configuration, and other software dependencies required for the energy monitoring application. The script will streamline the development environment setup process, ensuring consistent configurations across different machines and reducing manual setup time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated script to install and configure XAMPP, so that I can quickly set up a consistent development environment without manual configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL check if XAMPP is already installed
2. IF XAMPP is not installed THEN the system SHALL download and install the latest stable version
3. WHEN XAMPP is installed THEN the system SHALL configure Apache and MySQL services to start automatically
4. WHEN XAMPP installation completes THEN the system SHALL verify that Apache and MySQL services are running correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to manage PHP dependencies through Composer, so that all required packages are automatically installed and updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL check if Composer is installed
2. IF Composer is not installed THEN the system SHALL download and install Composer globally
3. WHEN Composer is available THEN the system SHALL run composer install in the energy-monitor directory
4. WHEN composer install completes THEN the system SHALL verify all dependencies are properly installed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to set up the database configuration, so that the application can connect to the MySQL database without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL create the required database if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN database creation completes THEN the system SHALL run Laravel migrations
3. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN database setup completes THEN the system SHALL verify the connection is working

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to configure environment variables, so that the application has the correct settings for the local development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL copy .env.example to .env if .env doesn't exist
2. WHEN .env file is created THEN the system SHALL update database connection settings for XAMPP
3. WHEN environment configuration completes THEN the system SHALL generate Laravel application key
4. WHEN all environment setup completes THEN the system SHALL validate configuration settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to handle Node.js dependencies, so that frontend assets are properly built and available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL check if Node.js and npm are installed
2. IF Node.js is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for Node.js installation
3. WHEN Node.js is available THEN the system SHALL run npm install in the energy-monitor directory
4. WHEN npm install completes THEN the system SHALL run npm run build to compile assets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to provide status feedback and error handling, so that I can understand what's happening and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each step executes THEN the system SHALL display clear progress messages
2. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was installed and configured
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the script to be cross-platform compatible, so that it works on different Windows environments and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL detect the Windows version and architecture
2. WHEN downloading software THEN the system SHALL select appropriate versions for the detected system
3. IF system requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL provide clear compatibility warnings
4. WHEN script execution completes THEN the system SHALL work on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems
